AN ARROW FUNCTION
An arrow function in JavaScript is a more concise way to write a function expression. It provides a shorthand syntax for writing functions. Arrow functions have some unique features, such as not binding their own this context.

CLASSES
 Classes are a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior in a single structure. They were introduced to make working with objects and inheritance easier and more intuitive, following a structure similar to object-oriented
programming languages like Java or C++.


DESTRUCTING
Destructuring is a convenient way of extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. It allows you to break down complex data structures into smaller, more manageable parts with a clean, concise syntax.

ARRAY METHODS
JavaScript provides a wide variety of array methods that help manipulate and interact with arrays efficiently. Here's an overview of some of the most commonly used array methods:
 push(), shift(), slice() etc
 
TERNARY OPERATOR
The ternary operator is a concise way to perform conditional expressions. It acts as a shorthand for the if-else statement, allowing you to evaluate a condition and return one of two values depending on whether the condition is true or false.


LET, CONST
In JavaScript, let and const are two keywords introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to declare variables, providing better scoping and immutability options compared to the older var keyword.
